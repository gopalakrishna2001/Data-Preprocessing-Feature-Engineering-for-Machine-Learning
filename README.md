# Data-Preprocessing & Feature-Engineering-for-Machine-Learning
## Project Objective:
Implementing Random Forest ML Algorithm to understand factors that influence housing price and effectively utlize the identified factor to model and predict house price in california. 
## Libraries Used:
- 1.Pandas
- 2.Matplotlib
- 3.Seaborn
- 4.Sklearn
- 5.Numpy
## Dataset
The dataset "Housing" contains ~20000 rows and 10 columns i.e., longitude	latitude,housing_median_age,total_rooms,total_bedrooms,population,households,median_income,median_house_value &	ocean_proximity.

## Algorithm
Random Forest classification algorithm.

## Observation's
### Data Processing:
  - 1.The dataset set had a total of ~30 null value.since the proportion of null values was negligible.Therefore, the null values were deleted.
  - 2.Any duplicate records with in the datasets was deleted.
  - 3.Categorical was encoded.
### Feature Engineering:
  - 1.To understand the influence of each factors,seaborn visuals were implement.
### ML Model Training:
  - 1.Train data was set to 80% of the dataset and remaining to test the data.
  - 2.Sklearn was utilized to model and test the Data.
  - 3.Algorithm used:Random Forest
