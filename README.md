# Data-Preprocessing & Feature-Engineering-for-Machine-Learning
## Project Objective:
Implementing Random Forest ML Algorithm to understand factors that influence housing price and effectively utlize the identified factor to model and predict house price in california. 
## Libraries Used:
1.Pandas
2.Matplotlib
3.Seaborn
4.Sklearn
5.Numpy
## Dataset
The dataset "Housing" contains ~20000 rows and 10 columns i.e., longitude	latitude,housing_median_age,total_rooms,total_bedrooms,population,households,median_income,median_house_value &	ocean_proximity.

## Algorithm
Random Forest classification algorithm.
